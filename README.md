# Seq2VAR: multivariate time series representation with relational neural networks and linear autoregressive model
Code for the paper Seq2VAR submitted at the AALTD workshop of ECML 2019

Warning: 

- Only the figures of the notebook "Seq2VAR_permutation.ipynb" matches with the one in the paper; notebook "Seq2VAR_homogeneous_springs.ipynb" gives additional illustrations

- Variations between paper's and notebook's result can exist since data generation has no fixed seed: difficulty of the problem can change from one generation to the other (signal-to-noise ratio, similarity between transition/permutation matrices, ...) and the subsequent plots and figures vary
